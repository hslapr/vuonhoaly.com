  <h2>Why learn through sentences?</h2>
  <p>It is much more efficient than memorizing word lists.</p>
  <h2>Supported languages</h2>
  <p>All languages using Latin script. Accent symbols are allowed.</p>
  <h2>How to use?</h2>
  <h3>Prepare the data file</h3>
  <p>Prepare a plain text file containing sentences that you want to learn. Here is a <a href="sample.txt">sample file</a>.</p>
  <p>The first line and each line with a preceding blank line are treated as valid sentences. <br>
    If a sentence contains newline, each line should end with a backslash "\" except the last line.
  </p>
  <h3>Load the file</h3>
  <p>Drag & drop your file to the application page.</p>
  <h3>Start learning</h3>
  <p>You can set the number of blanks. 0 means to show the original sentence. If you want to change the blank number of the current sentence, click "again" button after you change the number.</p>
  <p>Press <code>Ctrl+Enter</code> while the cursor is in a blank or click "check" button to check your answer.</p>
  <p>Pressing <code>Tab</code> key to move to the next blank. Press <code>Shift+Tab</code> to move to the last one.</p>
  <p>When the cursor is not in a blank, press <code>&rightarrow;</code>/<code>&leftarrow;</code> to go to the next/previous sentence.</p>
  <p>When the cursor is not in a blank, press <code>&uparrow;</code>/<code>&downarrow;</code> to add/reduce a blank and refresh. Press <code>Enter</code> to refresh without changing the number of blanks.</p>

<h2>Gender and Sexuality</h2>
<p>Q: When did you come to know that you are transgender?</p>
<p>A: I have been experiencing gender dysphoria since childhood, but I didn't know the word "transgender" until 2018. At first, I found it difficult to understand its meaning because people used it in different ways and was not sure if it described me. However, after learning about gender issues for years, now I'm quite sure that I am transgender.</p>

<h2>Language Learning</h2>
<p>Q: Which languages do you recommend in 2022?</p>
<p>A: If you have no idea, I recommend you choose from French and German. However, you should master English first.</p>

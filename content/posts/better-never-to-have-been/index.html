<h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>
<p>Each one of us was harmed by being brought into existence. That harm is not negligible, because the quality of even the best lives is very bad &ndash; and considerably worse than most people recognize it to be.
  Although it is obviously too late to prevent our own existence, it is not too late to prevent the existence of future possible people. Creating new people is thus morally problematic.
  In this book I argue for these claims and show why the usual responses to them &mdash; <b>incredulity</b>, if not <b>indignation</b> &mdash; are <b>defective</b>.</p>

<p>Given the deep resistance to the views I shall be defending, I have
  no expectation that this book or its arguments will have any impact
  on baby-making. Procreation will continue <b>undeterred</b>, causing a vast amount of harm.</p>

<p>I have written this book, then, not under
  the <b>illusion</b> that it will make (much) difference to the number of
  people there will be but rather from the opinion that what I have
  to say needs to be said whether or not it is accepted.</p>

<p>Many readers will be <b>inclined</b> to dismiss my arguments and
  will do so too <b>hastily</b>. When rejecting an unpopular view, it is
  extraordinarily easy to be overly confident in the force of one’s
  responses. This is partly because there is less felt need to justify
  one’s views when one is defending an orthodoxy. It is also partly
  because counter-responses from those critical of this orthodoxy,
  given their rarity, are harder to anticipate.

<p>The argument I advance in this book has been enhanced as a
  result of a number of engaging critical responses to earlier versions.
  Anonymous reviewers for the <cite>American Philosophical Quarterly</cite>
  offered worthy challenges, forcing me to improve the earliest versions.
  The two papers I published in that journal provided the basis
  for Chapter 2 of this book and I am grateful for permission to use
  that earlier material. Those papers were considerably reworked
  and developed partly as a result of many comments received in the
  intervening years and especially while I was writing this book. I am
  grateful to the University of Cape Town for a <b>sabbatical</b> semester
  in 2004, during which four of the book’s chapters were written.
  I presented material from various chapters in a number of <b>fora</b>,
  including the Philosophy Department at the University of Cape
  Town, Rhodes University in Grahamstown, South Africa, the Seventh World Congress of Bioethics in Sydney, Australia, and in the
  United States at the Jean Beer Blumenfeld Center for Ethics at Georgia State University, the Center for Bioethics at the University of
  Minnesota, and the Philosophy Department at the University of
  Alabama at Birmingham. I am grateful for the lively discussion
  on these occasions. For their helpful comments and suggestions, I
  should like to thank, among others, Andy Altman, Dan Brock, Bengt
  Brulde, Nick Fotion, Stephen Nathanson, Marty Perlmutter, Robert
  Segall, David Weberman, Bernhard Weiss, and Kit Wellman.</p>

<p>I am most grateful to the two reviewers for Oxford University
  Press, David Wasserman and David Boonin. They gave extensive
  comments that helped me anticipate the kinds of responses critical
  readers of the published work could have. I have attempted to raise
  and reply to these in revising the manuscript. I am sure that the
  book is much better for having considered their objections, even
  if they are not convinced by my replies. I am acutely aware, however,
  that there is always room for improvement and I only wish
  that I knew now, rather than later (or never), what improvements
  could be made.

<p>Finally, I should like to thank my parents and brothers for all
  they do and for all they are. This book is dedicated to them.</p>

<p>The central idea of this book is that coming into existence is always
  a serious harm. That idea will be defended at length, but the basic
  insight is quite simple: Although the good things in one’s life make
  it go better than it otherwise would have gone,
  <span class="text-decoration-underline">one could not have
    been deprived by their absence if one had not existed. Those who
    never exist cannot be deprived.</span>
  However, by coming into existence
  one does suffer quite serious harms that could not have <b>befallen</b>
  one had one not come into existence.
</p>

    <td>befallen</td>

<p>To say that the basic insight is quite simple is not to say that
  either it or what we can deduce from it will be undisputed. I
  shall consider all the anticipated objections in due course, and
  shall argue that they fail. The implication of all this is that
  coming into existence, far from ever constituting a net benefit,
  always constitutes a net harm. Most people, under the influence
  of powerful biological <b>dispositions</b> towards optimism, find this
  conclusion intolerable. They are still more indignant at the further
  implication that we should not create new people.

<p>Creating new people, by having babies, is so much a part of
  human life that it is rarely thought even to require a justification.
  Indeed, most people do not even think about whether they should
  or should not make a baby. They just make one. In other words,
  procreation is usually the consequence of sex rather than the result
  of a decision to bring people into existence. Those who do indeed
  <em>decide</em> to have a child might do so for any number of reasons, but
  <span class="text-decoration-underline">among these reasons cannot be the interests of the potential child.
  One can never have a child for that child’s sake.</span> That much should
  be apparent to everybody, even those who reject the stronger view
  for which I argue in this book&mdash;that not only does one not benefit
  people by bringing them into existence, but one <em>always</em> harms them.</p>
<p>My argument applies not only to humans but also to all other
  <b>sentient</b> beings. Such beings do not simply exist. They exist in a
  way that there is something that it feels like to exist. In other words,
  they are not merely objects but also subjects. Although sentience
  is a later evolutionary development and is a more complex state of
  being than insentience, it is far from clear that it is a better state
  of being. This is because sentient existence comes at a significant
  cost. In being able to experience, sentient beings are able to, and
  do, experience <em>unpleasantness</em>.</p>

<h1>David Benatar: <cite>BETTER NEVER TO HAVE BEEN</cite> &ndash; with notes</h1>
<p>Each one of us was harmed by being brought into existence. That harm is not negligible, because the quality of even the best lives is very bad &ndash; and considerably worse than most people recognize it to be.
  Although it is obviously too late to prevent our own existence, it is not too late to prevent the existence of future possible people. Creating new people is thus morally problematic.
  In this book I argue for these claims and show why the usual responses to them &mdash; <b>incredulity</b>, if not <b>indignation</b> &mdash; are <b>defective</b>.</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>incredulity</td>
    <td>the quality or state of being incredulous : disbelief</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>incredulous</td>
    <td>unwilling to admit or accept what is offered as true : not credulous : skeptical</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>indignation</td>
    <td>anger aroused by something unjust, unworthy, or mean</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>defective</td>
    <td>having a defect or flaw : imperfect in form, structure, or function</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>defect</td>
    <td>an imperfection or abnormality that impairs quality, function, or utility : shortcoming, flaw</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>Given the deep resistance to the views I shall be defending, I have
  no expectation that this book or its arguments will have any impact
  on baby-making. Procreation will continue <b>undeterred</b>, causing a vast amount of harm.</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>deter</td>
    <td>to turn aside, discourage, or prevent from acting</td>
  </tr>

<p>I have written this book, then, not under
  the <b>illusion</b> that it will make (much) difference to the number of
  people there will be but rather from the opinion that what I have
  to say needs to be said whether or not it is accepted.</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>illusion</td>
    <td>an incorrect idea : an idea that is based on something that is not true</td>
  </tr>

<p>Many readers will be <b>inclined</b> to dismiss my arguments and
  will do so too <b>hastily</b>. When rejecting an unpopular view, it is
  extraordinarily easy to be overly confident in the force of one’s
  responses. This is partly because there is less felt need to justify
  one’s views when one is defending an orthodoxy. It is also partly
  because counter-responses from those critical of this orthodoxy,
  given their rarity, are harder to anticipate.

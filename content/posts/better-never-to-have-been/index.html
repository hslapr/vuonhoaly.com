<h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>
<p>Each one of us was harmed by being brought into existence. That harm is not negligible, because the quality of even the best lives is very bad &ndash; and considerably worse than most people recognize it to be.
  Although it is obviously too late to prevent our own existence, it is not too late to prevent the existence of future possible people. Creating new people is thus morally problematic.
  In this book I argue for these claims and show why the usual responses to them&mdash;<b>incredulity</b>, if not <b>indignation</b>&mdash;are <b>defective</b>.</p>

<p>Given the deep resistance to the views I shall be defending, I have
  no expectation that this book or its arguments will have any impact
  on baby-making. Procreation will continue <b>undeterred</b>, causing a vast amount of harm.</p>

<p>I have written this book, then, not under
  the <b>illusion</b> that it will make (much) difference to the number of
  people there will be but rather from the opinion that what I have
  to say needs to be said whether or not it is accepted.</p>

<p>Many readers will be <b>inclined</b> to dismiss my arguments and
  will do so too <b>hastily</b>. When rejecting an unpopular view, it is
  extraordinarily easy to be overly confident in the force of one’s
  responses. This is partly because there is less felt need to justify
  one’s views when one is defending an orthodoxy. It is also partly
  because counter-responses from those critical of this orthodoxy,
  given their rarity, are harder to anticipate.

<p>The argument I advance in this book has been enhanced as a
  result of a number of engaging critical responses to earlier versions.
  Anonymous reviewers for the <cite>American Philosophical Quarterly</cite>
  offered worthy challenges, forcing me to improve the earliest versions.
  The two papers I published in that journal provided the basis
  for Chapter 2 of this book and I am grateful for permission to use
  that earlier material. Those papers were considerably reworked
  and developed partly as a result of many comments received in the
  intervening years and especially while I was writing this book. I am
  grateful to the University of Cape Town for a <b>sabbatical</b> semester
  in 2004, during which four of the book’s chapters were written.
  I presented material from various chapters in a number of <b>fora</b>,
  including the Philosophy Department at the University of Cape
  Town, Rhodes University in Grahamstown, South Africa, the Seventh World Congress of Bioethics in Sydney, Australia, and in the
  United States at the Jean Beer Blumenfeld Center for Ethics at Georgia State University, the Center for Bioethics at the University of
  Minnesota, and the Philosophy Department at the University of
  Alabama at Birmingham. I am grateful for the lively discussion
  on these occasions. For their helpful comments and suggestions, I
  should like to thank, among others, Andy Altman, Dan Brock, Bengt
  Brulde, Nick Fotion, Stephen Nathanson, Marty Perlmutter, Robert
  Segall, David Weberman, Bernhard Weiss, and Kit Wellman.</p>

<p>I am most grateful to the two reviewers for Oxford University
  Press, David Wasserman and David Boonin. They gave extensive
  comments that helped me anticipate the kinds of responses critical
  readers of the published work could have. I have attempted to raise
  and reply to these in revising the manuscript. I am sure that the
  book is much better for having considered their objections, even
  if they are not convinced by my replies. I am acutely aware, however,
  that there is always room for improvement and I only wish
  that I knew now, rather than later (or never), what improvements
  could be made.

<p>Finally, I should like to thank my parents and brothers for all
  they do and for all they are. This book is dedicated to them.</p>

<p>The central idea of this book is that coming into existence is always
  a serious harm. That idea will be defended at length, but the basic
  insight is quite simple: Although the good things in one’s life make
  it go better than it otherwise would have gone,
  <span class="text-decoration-underline">one could not have
    been deprived by their absence if one had not existed. Those who
    never exist cannot be deprived.</span>
  However, by coming into existence
  one does suffer quite serious harms that could not have <b>befallen</b>
  one had one not come into existence.
</p>

    <td>befallen</td>

<p>To say that the basic insight is quite simple is not to say that
  either it or what we can deduce from it will be undisputed. I
  shall consider all the anticipated objections in due course, and
  shall argue that they fail. The implication of all this is that
  coming into existence, far from ever constituting a net benefit,
  always constitutes a net harm. Most people, under the influence
  of powerful biological <b>dispositions</b> towards optimism, find this
  conclusion intolerable. They are still more indignant at the further
  implication that we should not create new people.

<p>Creating new people, by having babies, is so much a part of
  human life that it is rarely thought even to require a justification.
  Indeed, most people do not even think about whether they should
  or should not make a baby. They just make one. In other words,
  procreation is usually the consequence of sex rather than the result
  of a decision to bring people into existence. <span class="text-decoration-underline">Those who do indeed
  <em>decide</em> to have a child might do so for any number of reasons, but
  among these reasons cannot be the interests of the potential child.
  One can never have a child for that child’s sake.</span> That much should
  be apparent to everybody, even those who reject the stronger view
  for which I argue in this book&mdash;that not only does one not benefit
  people by bringing them into existence, but one <em>always</em> harms them.</p>
<p>My argument applies not only to humans but also to all other
  <b>sentient</b> beings. Such beings do not simply exist. They exist in a
  way that there is something that it feels like to exist. In other words,
  they are not merely objects but also subjects. Although sentience
  is a later evolutionary development and is a more complex state of
  being than insentience, it is far from clear that it is a better state
  of being. This is because sentient existence comes at a significant
  cost. In being able to experience, sentient beings are able to, and
  do, experience <em>unpleasantness</em>.</p>
<table><tr>
  <td>sentient</td>
  <td>responsive to or conscious of sense impressions</td>

<p>Although I think that coming into existence harms all sentient
  beings and I shall sometimes speak about all such beings, my focus
  will be on humans. There are a few reasons for this focus, other
  than the <b>sheer</b> convenience of it. The first is that people find the
  conclusion hardest to accept when it applies to themselves. The
  focus on humans, rather than on all sentient life, reinforces its
  application to humans. A second reason is that, with one exception,
  the argument has most practical significance when applied to
  humans because we can act on it by <b>desisting</b> from producing
  children. The exception is the case of human breeding of animals,<sup><a href="#footnote-1-1">1</a></sup>
  from which we could also desist. A third reason for focusing on
  humans is that those humans who do not desist from producing
  children cause suffering to those about whom they tend to care
  most&mdash;their own children. This may make the issues more vivid
  for them than they otherwise would be.</p>

<p id="footnote-1-1"><sup>1</sup>I treat this as an exception because humans breed only a small proportion of
  all species of sentient animals. Although this is an exceptional case, it has great
  significance, given the amount of harm inflicted on those animals that humans breed
  for food and other commodities, and is thus worthy of brief discussion now. One
  particularly poor argument in defence of eating meat is that if humans did not eat
  animals, those animals would not have been brought into existence in the first place.
  Humans would simply not have bred them in the numbers they do breed them.
  The claim is that although these animals are killed, this cost to them is outweighed
  by the benefit to them of having been brought into existence. This is an appalling
  argument for many reasons (some of which are outlined by Robert Nozick. See his
  Anarchy, State and Utopia (Oxford: Blackwell, 1974) 38&mdash;9). First, the lives of many of
  these animals are so bad that even if one rejected my argument one would still have
  to think that they were harmed by being brought into existence. Secondly, those who
  advance this argument fail to see that it could apply as readily to human babies that
  are produced only to be eaten. Here we see quite clearly that being brought into
  existence only to be killed for food is no benefit. It is only because killing animals
  is thought to be acceptable that the argument is thought to have any force. In fact
  it adds nothing to the (mistaken) view that killing animals for food is acceptable.
  Finally, the argument that animals are benefited by being brought into existence
  only to be killed ignores the argument that I shall develop in Chapters 2 and 3&mdash;that
  coming into existence is itself, quite independently of how much the animal then
  suffers, always a serious harm.</p>
